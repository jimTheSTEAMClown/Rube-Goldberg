// This is where you define Variables and Constants
int LED = 13;

// The setup routine runs once when you load a sketch or press reset:
void setup()
{
	// initialize the pins used in this sketch
        // This is where you define pin directions
	pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // LED where you assigned it on pin 13
}

// this "main" loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop()
{
	//Set pin 13 to HIGH. This provides 5v to the LED & turns it on
	digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
	delay(1000);	//Wait for a second
	//Set pin 13 LOW and This turns the LED off
	digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
	delay(1000);	//Wait for a second
}
